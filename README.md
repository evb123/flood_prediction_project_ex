# flood_prediction_project_ex
Partial project example - to use as example of coding abilities.
***
This repository includes some examples of the code that I personally wrote that was used in a group data science project on predicting future risk of 
flooding in the UK.

My main responsibilities included:
- finding/extacting/cleaning/engineering data on model features predicted in the future (rainfall, windspeed, and air pressure; python and SQL)
- organizing the creation of and creating the visualisation using plotly dash (python)
